	OPERATING SYSTEMS PROJECT TASK (2019) REQUIREMENTS

Student must implement a file system:
1. File system should be inspired by NTFS or ext4.
2. Whole file system is stored in a single binary file on the host operating system.
3. File system tree is organised in maximum 2 levels of depth, for example: root/dir1/file1.
4. Access to files and directories is always granted with absolute path: root/dir1/file1.
5. Maximum size of file system is 20 MB, maximum size of a single file is 64 kB.
6. File data must be stored in blocks of minimal size 5 B. Extents should be used wherever possible to minimize memory fragmentation.
7. Interaction with file system must be enabled through optional command/graphic interface.
8. Speed of the application is not of primary interest.
9. Minimal command requirements (modeled on Linux commands): mkdir, create, put, get, ls, cp, mv, rename, echo, cat, rm (with -r), stat.
10. More commands can be added (optional).
11. The following tolerances are allowed:
	NTFS implementation: all attributes are resident;
	ext4 implementation: it is not necessary to keep i-nodes in groups, no indirect pointers.
